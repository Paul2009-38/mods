# rename
Hello, this Mod adds a seal, a priv called rename and a rename formspec.
You can rename the current Item / Node that you have in hand with /rename,
then you can put in the new Name, but that is only possible if you have the rename priv.
The seal is just for renaming it maybe to "Team Member".
